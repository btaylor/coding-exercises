GSoC progress report #2 – First .app-Bundle available
Icon flicker bug

Around the time I started the GSoC project, I merged the xamarin and David’s
bockbuild tree together into a single one. Ever since then, there was a very
nagging bug with the icons in the sources view, which randomly flickered and
disappeared when hovering with the mouse. Someone on the mailing list could
reproduce that, so sth. needed to be done about that. As I remember that didn’t
happen on previous builds, I searched through what packages got updated in the
merge and started to play around by compiling different versions. This is a very
time consuming task, as I have to rebuild the full
gtk+/gtk-sharp/pango/cairo/gtk-mac-integration stack when changing versions of a
single package. After some patient hours I found out that the update to latest
cairo introduced that bug, so for today’s alpha build I downgraded to cairo
1.10.2. I will investigate that further, to have it fixed in the upstream
  versions.
