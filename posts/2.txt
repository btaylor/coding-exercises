Woven. More Betterer Than Ever :)
“More betterer” isn’t quite right grammatically, but what else describes the
improvements we just introduced for those of you with Woven on your Kindle Fire,
NOOK Tablet, NOOK Color, or Android phone or tablet?

We’ve just rolled out one of the most requested features for Woven—support for
photo albums you’ve already created on services like Facebook, Picasa, and
SmugMug. It’s now easier than ever to find a special photo or tell a story about
a memorable vacation or birthday party.

We’ve also refreshed Woven’s design to better showcase your photos, added an
uploader for those of you with cameras on-board, and streamlined our “getting
started” process. Not to mention, many small tweaks and performance fixes. Our
vision of easy, fun on-the-go storytelling is indeed getting closer.

Our team’s excited to bring these improvements to life for you, our friends, and
our families! If you provided feedback, thanks for making them priorities for
us. Let us know what you’d like to see next. We appreciate your support.

ps. – Thanks to Urban Dictionary for the “more betterer” inspiration!
Questionable grammar but a fun website.
