New Things GNOME
I haven't blogged in a long time,so I thought I would post about what I've been
doing...
I spent a lot of time in the last few months working on integrating my High
Contrast work into the Symbolic Theme. Jakub Steiner and Lapo Calamandrei have
been very generous with their time and expertise --giving me technical pointers,
critiquing my work, editing, and adding new icons to the set. I was looking at
the Gnome-Themes-Standard git on GNOME.org, and it looks like Cosimo Cecchi
wrote his build-time hack for High Contrast (I get most of my information about
GNOME by reading git commits and Bugzilla, so...). The base set for the High
Contrast and High Contrast Inverse Themes will still be short some icons, but
what we have in 3.4 will be a big improvement :)
