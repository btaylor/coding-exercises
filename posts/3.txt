Woven. Now For the iPhone.
Hey, Apple iPhone owners! You thought we left you out, didn’t you? We’d never do
that. We love our iPhones too!

We’re really proud of the just-released version of Woven for the iPhone. Like
the iPad-only version we released in March, it gathers together your photos from
a number of online storage services and creates a unified collection for
on-the-go browsing and storytelling.

 “People today live on the go, and their memories should too,” says John Chuang,
our founder and CEO. “Now that Woven is available on the iPhone, our app has
almost ubiquitous support across the world’s leading smart phones, e-readers,
and tablets. We’re excited about providing hundreds of millions of people with
the means of viewing photos and replaying stories in their hands, instantly.”

The iPhone and iPod touch version of Woven, along with the already available
iPad version, can both be downloaded free of charge from the iTunes App Store
via woventheapp.com/ios.

Woven is also supported on the NOOK Tablet, NOOK Color, Kindle Fire, and
Android-powered phones and tablets. With a free account, a Woven user can
effortlessly access their entire photo collection across any and all of these
devices – anywhere, anytime.
