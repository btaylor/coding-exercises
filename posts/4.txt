Finally, Instagram on Android!
Android-ians, rejoice! The ever-popular, ever-growing, ever-retro Instagram is
now released on Google Play for Android smartphones. Once available exclusively
for iPhone users, the makers of Instagram have decided to reach out to millions
of Android users. And why not? Studies have shown that there are over 850,000
Android activations per day.While the Android app’s user interface is very
similar to that of the iPhone’s, Instagram doesn’t use the Android’s native
buttons. The menu, home, and back keys are not operational. While this could
throw some Android users off, the straightforward UI proves no complication.
Turns out you really don’t need those external buttons. And, in some ways, it
makes the similarities between Android phones and iPhones a bit stronger.
Cross-platform UIs can be tricky, but Instagram may have done it right to make a
strong user experience.So now, Android users can upload photos to Instagram.
And, guess what you can do from there? If you’re thinking that you can link your
Instagram account to your Woven account for all your viewing and collecting
ease, then you are thinking correct, my friends. Oh, and another reason to
rejoice– yesterday was Free Cone Day at Ben & Jerry’s! How do we at Woven
celebrate? Why, taking pictures of the huge lines at Boston Ben & Jerry’s stores
and posting them on Instagram, of course!
