Congratulations!
Congratulations to Desiree K. of Key West, Florida! Desiree entered Woven’s
recent “My Mom Is Beautiful Inside and Out” contest and won a pair of NOOK
Tablets.

In her own words, “She has been there for me through the worst and the best of
times. From her I have learned that anything is possible if you just go for it.
When mom sets out to do something, it gets done. No task is too daunting for my
mom.”

Desiree, thank you for sharing your story and photo with us. Your mom sounds
like a truly beautiful person.

We also awarded an honorable mention prize to Karen M. of Wingdale, New York who
touched us all with her kind words about her mom.

Karen wrote, “She had the softest hands. She baked chocolate chip cookies every
Saturday and kept them in a bunny cookie jar. She loved me no matter what I did.
She knew when something was wrong and would call me before I could call her. She
worked her whole life for others. She never cursed. She called me babe and
honey. The last thing she ever said to me was “always keep the smile on your
face”. She made me who I am today. I miss her so much.”

Thanks to everyone who participated in the contest. We had a lot of fun and hope
you did too!
